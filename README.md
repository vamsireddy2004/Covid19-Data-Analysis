COVID-19 Data Analysis Project
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of COVID-19 datasets to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to the pandemic. Using Python and libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy, the analysis covers various metrics, including infection rates, recovery trends, and mortality rates across different regions.

Key Features:
        Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and ensuring dataset consistency.
        Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualization of infection, recovery, and mortality trends.
        Statistical Insights: Analyzing correlation between variables such as vaccination rates and COVID cases.
        Visualizations: Line plots, bar charts, heatmaps, and more to represent key findings.
        Jupyter Notebook: Contains detailed code and comments for easy understanding.
Technologies Used:
        Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
        Jupyter Notebook
        COVID-19 datasets from [Kaggle]
Project Goal:
        The aim of this project is to understand the spread and impact of COVID-19 through data analysis, helping to derive actionable insights for better decision-making.
